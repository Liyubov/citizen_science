# Citizen science open data analysis
Here we do data analysis for citizen science projects with the open data https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/city-nature-challenge-2019
The project is in progress (discussions @Liubov, Muki, CRI)


# Reseach Questions

RQ1 Can we identify macroscopic laws of citizen science projects so that long term dynamics is different?

RQ2 How communities are growing in time, what drives their growth if not preferential attachment or exogeneous factors?
