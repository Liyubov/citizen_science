# Citizen science open data analysis
Here we do data analysis for citizen science projects with the open data https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/city-nature-challenge-2019
The project is in progress and discussions between @Liubov Tupikina, Muki Haklay, CRI.


# Reseach Questions

RQ1 Can we identify macroscopic laws of citizen science projects so that long term dynamics is different?

RQ2 How communities are growing in time, what drives their growth if not preferential attachment or exogeneous factors?

RQ3 If we are looking at City Nature Challenge data - we have now  data for San Francisco, LA, and London, which now have 4 or 3 years time series, and it is interesting to look how the power law like distribution is emerging? 
It's interesting that it is similar for SF and LA and the pattern that they have in year 4, London has in year 3. 

RQ4 (a) Are their differences in data collection pattern in each year and between years? Are there also emerging pattern over time in a location? 
(b) Are there also emerging pattern over time in a location?
